# Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram

Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram is an intelligent surveillance system built using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning. It leverages real-time video processing and object detection to identify motion from humans, cats, and dogs, and sends automated alerts (images or videos) directly to a Telegram chat via a bot interface. This project is ideal for security, home automation, or pet monitoring applications, offering an interactive and responsive way to track activity through a simple yet powerful communication channel.

## Features:

- **üé• Motion Detection:** Utilizes a reliable background updating model and threshold methods to detect complete moving objects, including humans, cats, and dogs.

- **üì≤ Telegram Bot Integration:** Sends notifications to an admin via a Telegram chat bot when movements are detected. Enables real-time communication by retrieving images and videos.
  
- **üì∏ On-Demand Image Capture**
Responds to /image command to capture and send the current camera frame.

- **üéûÔ∏è On-Demand Video Recording**
Responds to /video command to record and send a short video from the live feed.

- **üí¨ Smart Interaction**
Responds to greetings and provides a help menu via /help or similar commands.
