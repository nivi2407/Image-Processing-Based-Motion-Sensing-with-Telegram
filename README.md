# Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram

Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram is an intelligent surveillance system built using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning. It leverages real-time video processing and object detection to identify motion from humans, cats, and dogs, and sends automated alerts (images or videos) directly to a Telegram chat via a bot interface. This project is ideal for security, home automation, or pet monitoring applications, offering an interactive and responsive way to track activity through a simple yet powerful communication channel.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The system continuously captures video frames.
2. Compares consecutive frames to detect motion.
3. If motion is detected:
   - Captures an image of the frame.
   - Sends a notification (with image) to a Telegram chat using a bot.

## Key Features:

- Real-time motion detection
- Frame differencing using OpenCV
- Telegram bot integration for instant alerts
- Captures and sends a snapshot when motion is detected
- Lightweight and can run on Raspberry Pi or PC
  
## Setup instructions:

**Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nivi2407/Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram.git
   cd Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram
```
## Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy telepot
```

## ðŸ¤– Telegram Bot Setup

1. Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. Type `/newbot` and follow the steps to create your bot.
3. Copy the **Bot Token** given by BotFather.
4. Get your **Chat ID** using tools like [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'your-telegram-bot-token'
CHAT_ID = 'your-chat-id'
```
