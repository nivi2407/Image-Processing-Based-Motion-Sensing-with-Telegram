# Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram
> Real-time object detection and motion alerts via Telegram

Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram is an intelligent surveillance system built using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning. It leverages real-time video processing and object detection to identify motion from humans, cats, and dogs, and sends automated alerts (images or videos) directly to a Telegram chat via a bot interface. This project is ideal for security, home automation, or pet monitoring applications, offering an interactive and responsive way to track activity through a simple yet powerful communication channel.

## üöÄ How It Works

- üì∑ **Capture**: Continuously captures video frames.
- üîç **Detect**: Compares consecutive frames to detect motion.
- üì° **Notify**: If motion is detected:
  - Takes a snapshot.
  - Sends a Telegram alert with the image.

## ‚ú® Key Features:

- ‚è±Ô∏è Real-time motion detection
- üß† Frame differencing using OpenCV
- ü§ñ Telegram bot integration for instant alerts
- üì∏ Captures and sends a snapshot when motion is detected
- üíª Lightweight ‚Äì runs on Raspberry Pi or PC
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup instructions:

### Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nivi2407/Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram.git
   cd Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram
```
### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy telepot
```

### ü§ñ Telegram Bot Setup

1. Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. Type `/newbot` and follow the prompts.
3. Copy the **Bot Token** given by BotFather.
4. Get your **Chat ID** via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'your-telegram-bot-token'
CHAT_ID = 'your-chat-id'
```
