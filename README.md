# Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram

Image Processing-Based Motion Sensing with Telegram is an intelligent surveillance system built using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning. It leverages real-time video processing and object detection to identify motion from humans, cats, and dogs, and sends automated alerts (images or videos) directly to a Telegram chat via a bot interface. This project is ideal for security, home automation, or pet monitoring applications, offering an interactive and responsive way to track activity through a simple yet powerful communication channel.

## Key Features:

- 🎥 Motion detection using OpenCV
- 🤖 Telegram bot alerts sent upon motion
- 💬 Optional snapshot/image capture on motion
- 🖥️ Works on PC or Raspberry Pi with webcam
  
## 🚀 How It Works

1. The system continuously captures video frames.
2. Image processing (frame differencing) is used to detect motion.
3. On motion detection:
   - A notification is sent to a predefined Telegram chat.
   - An image can optionally be saved or sent.

## Setup instructions:

**Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nivi2407/Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram.git
   cd Image-Processing-Based-Motion-Sensing-with-Telegram
```
## Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy telepot
```

## 🤖 Telegram Bot Setup

1. Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. Type `/newbot` and follow the steps to create your bot.
3. Copy the **Bot Token** given by BotFather.
4. Get your **Chat ID** using tools like [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
5. Store credentials in `bot_config.py`:
```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'your-telegram-bot-token'
CHAT_ID = 'your-chat-id'
```
